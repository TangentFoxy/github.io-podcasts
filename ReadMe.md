# github.io-podcasts
A feed / site generator for using GitHub Pages (or compatible service) to publish a basic podcast.

Windows-only for the time being.

[Apple's Podcast Requirements](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements)
is a good hub for learning about what is expected in podcast RSS feeds and such.  
Of particular importance is their list of [Podcast Categories](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/1691-apple-podcasts-categories).
- [A Podcasterâ€™s Guide to RSS](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390) might be *even better*.
- [Artwork requirements](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/896-artwork-requirements) are not as strict as stated.
- [How to create an episode](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/825-how-to-create-an-episode) may be useful. New tag types have been added.

Useful tools:
- [Cast Feed Validator](https://www.castfeedvalidator.com)
